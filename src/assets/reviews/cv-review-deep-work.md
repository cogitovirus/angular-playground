The ability to focus is a powerful skill. Especially in modern times, where various applications
always seem to try to attract, divert and sell our attention to the highest bidder.

Recently, I've been thinking more and more about creativity and methods to increase my productivity. Why, despite
my inner need and longing for bringing new ideas into reality, things have been moving so dreadfully slow?

Well the answer for this question is quite simple. The solution is not.

I've been swollowed whole by daily routine tasks. Always checking what is happening on Slack, replying to emails,
reading latest news or tech articles or attending meetings during which I had little to say nor cared enough about what was being said.
As a result, I was not making tangible progress in projects that mattered. That were suppose to be the central point of my attention.

Having my initial diagnosis, I then turned to books and articles on the topic of time manegement to find a solution.
The one that impressed me the most, was Deep Work by Cal Newport. Written in a clear and concise fashion, it
describes the concept of deep work - an ability to concentrate on a congitively diffucult task without distractions.
This allows to achieve better results in shorter time and what's most important, creates a sense of fulfillment from
completing your goals.

What's also valuable in the book itself to me, is that it is free from any cheap philosophies or coaching, which is
common even in the highest rated classics on managing yourself.

After completing the book, I've started to implement the techniques I've learned. Apart from the actual mental exercise of
focusing on one complex task at a time, even the tiniest changes in my routines and work setup brought measurable effects.
I already opted out of social media some time ago,
but some of reedemed time was still going to undesirable places. The list of tiny optimizations included:
- getting rid of the Google Chrome gmail plugin. You don't really need to know that you got mail this instance.
Limit the time to check your personal email to once per day
- closing the slack app or Outlook entirely, when I need a longer span of focus
- 

This allows me to keep laser focus on the tasks, that in the long term bring the most value. The ones that 
are the one that will bring satisfaction from your life

Post Scriptum. One last great thing that came ofter reading Cal's Newport book, If that I started to search for quality music for concentration.
I don't always like listening to music while doing long stretches of work, but there are certain pieces, that induce
a stake of flow, zen or hovewer you want to put it. That's how I have found this gem:
